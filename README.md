# Multithread Basics

## Objectives
- Review the concepts of multithreaded programming and utilize them correctly
- Review the different methods of creating threads in java
- Utilize interrupts and debug a program using them
- Familiarize with Thread Pools


## Tasks
1. I Forked this repository and clone the fork to my local machine.Then create a new Git branch before starting your work
2. Completed the following exercises based on the instructions provided:

   - `CPU Simulator`: Simulate a single core CPU and schedule tasks to run on a thread
   - `Find Multiples`: write a multithreaded program to find all integers in a given range that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7. Return the sum of all unique integers.
   - `Use Interrupts`: Analyze the provided code and add interrupts where a thread must be terminated. Handle each interrupt in its respective thread.
3. Commit my changes and push my commits to my fork on Github. Created a pull request to merge my changes to the main branch of my fork on Github.


## Evaluation
- Compile and run without any errors
- Well-organized, readable, properly commented and should follow clean code principles
- Pass all of the provided unit tests
- Use Git for version control and include meaningful commit messages
